If you have had pain for 3 months or more, then it is classified as chronic pain. This pain is common and can be caused by conditions such as arthritis, nerve damage, the result of an injury or problem that has often healed. Sometimes it develops slowly over time as a result of an injury or surgery; sometimes it seems to develop for no particular reason.
</p>
<p>
Chronic pain is different to acute pain as it doesn’t seem to go away and often doesn’t respond to treatments. After 3 – 6 months, the body is healed as well as can be expected.
If you have had pain for a few days or weeks, this is acute pain. It’s often associated with tissue damage such as a sprained ankle. Pain is an unpleasant signal in the body, which in acute pain acts as a warning signal. Pain demands attention and interrupts our daily lives. We want an explanation about our pain and pain insists that we get help to relieve it.
</p>
<p>
Acute pain is normally relieved either by time, physiotherapy, medical or surgical treatment, pain killers, or a mixture of treatments. Sometimes it can be relieved without medical treatments.
Extensive research has shown that having chronic pain can lead to sadness, depression, anxiety, isolation, stress, low mood, a sense of hopelessness and worthlessness.
