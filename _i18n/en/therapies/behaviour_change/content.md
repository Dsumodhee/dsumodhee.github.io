Whether it is quitting smoking, eating healthily, taking up exercise or weight management, changing a behaviour or routine can improve one’s well being. However, changing behaviour practised over years can be challenging.

I design behaviour change interventions with the most up-to-date findings in behaviour change science with theories, behaviour change techniques, motivational interviewing and problem solving techniques to help to adopt health-enhancing behaviours or stop health-damaging ones. I tailor each intervention according to my client’s needs.
