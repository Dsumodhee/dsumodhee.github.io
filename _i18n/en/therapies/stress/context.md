Disturbing statistics have found that 59% of British adults claim their life is more stressful today than it was five years ago, while five million people in the UK are ‘very’ or ‘extremely’ stressed through work.
The Health and Safety Executive also estimates that 9.9m working days were lost due to stress, depression and anxiety in 2014-15.

I offer treatment and therapy options for those who feel they’re having trouble coping with the stresses and strains of life.
With psychological therapy you can get help by identify sources of stress and inappropriate coping mechanisms and learn new strategies for building stress resilience.
