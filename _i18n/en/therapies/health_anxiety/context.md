Everyone has feelings of anxiety at some point in their life.
For example, you may feel worried and anxious about sitting an exam,
or having a medical test or a job interview. If you have a generalized anxiety
disorder, you tend to worry about a number of things in your daily life.
Generalised anxiety disorder is a long-term condition that causes you to feel
anxious about a wide range of situations and issues, rather than one specific
event. It can have a significant effect on your daily life, but several different
treatments are available that can ease your symptoms. Cognitive behavioural
therapy can help change an anxious mindset to one of increased positivity.
