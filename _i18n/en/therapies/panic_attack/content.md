A panic attack (or panic disorder) is a feeling of anxiety, stress and panic, which occur regularly and at any time, often for no apparent reason. Most panic attacks last for between 5 and 20 minutes.

Symptoms include:

* a racing heartbeat
* feeling faint
* sweating
* nausea
* chest pain
* shortness of breath
* trembling

Cognitive behavioural therapy can help change a panicky mindset to one of increased calmness.
