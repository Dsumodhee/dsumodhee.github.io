I have in-depth experience in delivering undergraduate and postgraduate teaching sessions as well as delivering training to healthcare and non-healthcare professionals. I have undertaken accredited training and am able to provide supervision for clinical supervision or generic needs. I offer a supportive environment to encourage reflection and offer a range of supervision models to best support you and your needs.
