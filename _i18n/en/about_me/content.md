I am a Chartered Health Psychologist registered with the British Psychological Society (BPS) and the Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC).

I have completed a Professional Doctorate in Health Psychology. 
I am a highly qualified Health Psychologist with 7 years 
of experience in helping people with addictive 
health-damaging habits such as smoking or self-manage 
health conditions (respiratory, oncology, pain, ophthalmic). 
I am passionate about helping people live healthier and 
happier lives. I use the most effective and theory-based 
approach to provide the best psychological treatment. 
I tailor each treatment according to my clientâ€™s need 
to have the best therapeutic outcome. I use various 
therapeutic tools such as behaviour change techniques, 
CBT, and mindfulness.

As part of my research career, I conduct multi-strand quantitative and qualitative research specialising in health and wellbeing (publications listed below). I translate health and psychological research findings into insightful and innovative healthcare solutions. I aspire to identify gaps and weaknesses in health services to offer insightful strategies to satisfy unmet needs. I disseminate my work through conference presentations and paper publications. Every year I present and participate in conferences and seminars as part of my Continuing Professional Development.


## I offer psychological treatments in English and French.
